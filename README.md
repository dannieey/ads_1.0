TIME COMPLEXITY:
1) Problem 1: O(n)  --> for(int i=1; i<arr.length; i++){ //running from the second element(arr[1]) till the end
            if(min>arr[i]){ //compare each element with the min variable (compare if an arr[i] element is less than min)
                min=arr[i]; 
            } //so it just linearly goes through the array wth n elements
2) Problem 2: O(n) ->  for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
                         sum+=arr[i]; //linearly goes through an array`s elements (n)
3) Problem 3: O(sqrt(n)) ->  for(int i=2; i*i<=n; i++){ //starting with i=2 (because of the condition of the prime num divisors) till i*i<=n (because another half interval is repetitive if divisors)
            if(n%i==0){ //since here we check num`s divisors from 2 till sqrt(n) not till n 
4) Problem 4: O(n) --> return n * factorial(n - 1); //since the function call yourself n time  
5) Problem 5: O(2^n) --> return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); --> since the function call yourself twice on each step  
6) Problem 6: O(n) --> return a * powNum(a, n - 1); //since it has n time recursion calls  
7) Problem 7: 
8) Problem 8: O(n) --> for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {   
   if(!Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) { //it goes through each element only ones (n times in sum)  
9) Problem 9: O(2^n) --> return binCoeff(n - 1, k - 1) + binCoeff(n - 1, k); //since it calls the function twice  
10) Problem 10: gcd(a,b)=gcd(b, a mod b) there we need consider the speed how b decreasing, if between a and b there is a big difference, then there will be less steps to find gcd, however if we consider for example a list with a fibinacci concept (not thet big difference between elements), thats mean that it equals to n steps in fibonacci list that is logb--> time complexity is O(logb)
